Significance:
Aligning these two strands of protein DNA sequences of an avian flu virus found in different parts of Indonesia in 2017 is significant because although the two sequences are very similar (which makes sense because it's the same strand of flu), differences between the two strands can signifdt mutations, and point deletions/insertions that can be useful when trying to make a vaccine for the flu virus, and could mean possible resistance gained against antibiotics if the sequences were taken at different times.
